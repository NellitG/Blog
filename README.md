**Learn Laravel**

Laravel is fun


Route: Think of it like a menu


Controllers:Think of it like a chef


Models = The recipe book (where ingredients/data are stored)

Views (Blade) = The plating (how it looks on the table)


**Example:**
If a user visits /about:

Route sees /about → sends it to AboutController

Controller maybe fetches “About Us” text from database

View turns it into HTML

Laravel sends that HTML to your browser
